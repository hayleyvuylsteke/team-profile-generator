# Team Profile Generator

This project was built to the module 10 homework requirements of the University of Toronto Coding Bootcamp program.

## Project Description
The Team Profile Generator allows a user to enter information about their team to generate a team profile HTML page. The data captures information on three different types of employees:
 - The Team Manager
 - Engineers
 - Interns
 
 For all employees, the program will ask for their:
  - Name
  - Employee ID
  - Email Address
  
  If the employee is a manager, it will also ask for phone number. If the employee is an Engineer, it will ask for their github username. If the employee is an intern, it will ask for the school they attend. 
  
  Once the user indicates they are done adding team members, an HTML file with all of the employees details is generated.
